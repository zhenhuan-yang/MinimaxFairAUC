# Empirical Evaluation for "Minimax AUC Fairness: Efficient Algorithm with Provable Convergence"

To speed up the process, we only apply 3 random seeds in training and testing. It takes about 5 hours to finish all experiments. Please follow the steps to run experiments.

## (Optional) Install dependencies in your virtual environment

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Run Algorithm 1 in Table 2

`bash table2.sh`

The above command will write to the screen and then generate a new file named `table2` to save results.

## Run Algorithm 1 in Figure 2

`bash figure2.sh`

The above command will generate a new folder named `figure2` to save results.
